* smp_sys

Part of the sensorimotor primitives aka /smp/ ecosystem designed to
cooperate with [[https://github.com/x75/smp_base][smp_base]] and [[https://github.com/x75/smp_graphs][smp_graphs]]. The /sys/ part stands for
systems, where a system is anything that produces data. This can be a
robot, or a logfile reader but also an economy or a social process.

** Implemented systems
  - n-dimensional point mass (the simplest robot with motility,
    i.e. that can move it's base)
  - simplearm (flowersteam's [[https://github.com/flowersteam/explauto][explauto]])
  - bha (bionic handling assistant model, python port by
    [[https://github.com/gitmatti][Mathias Schmerling]] of the [[https://code.cor-lab.de/projects/goal-babbling-matlab][bha matlab model]])
  - more coming, stay tuned

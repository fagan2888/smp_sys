* smp_sys

Part of the sensorimotor primitives (smp) ecosystem and designed to
work together with [[https://github.com/x75/smp_base][smp_base]] and [[https://github.com/x75/smp_graphs][smp_graphs]]. The /sys/ bit stands for
/systems/. In the smp context, a system is anything that produces data
and usually that is a robot, a different robot, or a file reader but
could also be a network feed (network monitoring, market data, social
network channels, ...), a wireless sensor network, a smart home, and
so on.

** Implemented systems
  - n-dimensional point mass (the simplest robot with motility,
    i.e. that can move it's base)
  - simplearm (flowersteam's [[https://github.com/flowersteam/explauto][explauto]])
  - bha (bionic handling assistant model, python port by
    [[https://github.com/gitmatti][Mathias Schmerling]] of the [[https://code.cor-lab.de/projects/goal-babbling-matlab][bha matlab model]])
  - more coming, stay tuned

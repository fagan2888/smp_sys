# smp\_sys

Part of the sensorimotor primitives aka *smp* ecosystem designed to
cooperate with [smp\_base](https://github.com/x75/smp_base) and [smp\_graphs](https://github.com/x75/smp_graphs). The *sys* part stands for
systems, where a system is anything that produces data. This can be a
robot, or a logfile reader but also an economy or a social process.


## Implemented systems

-   n-dimensional point mass (the simplest robot with motility,
    i.e. that can move it's base)
-   simplearm (flowersteam's [explauto](https://github.com/flowersteam/explauto))
-   bha (bionic handling assistant model, python port by
    [Mathias Schmerling](https://github.com/gitmatti) of the [bha matlab model](https://code.cor-lab.de/projects/goal-babbling-matlab))
-   more coming, stay tuned
